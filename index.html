<h1>Name: Fritzgerald M. Urbano</h1>
<h2>Nickname: Gerald</h2>
<h2>Favorite CMSC subject: CMSC 12</h2>
<p>This introduced me to the world of programming and it became the foundation of my life as computer science student in UPLB. It got me into programming even though I have no idea about programming.</p>
<h2>Favorite GE: STS</h2>
<p>STS became my favorite GE subject because it is really informative and it has a positive classroom atmosphere unlike other GE's I already took. I also love how my classmates are very friendly and approachable even though we don't know each other.</p>
<h2>Favorite programming language: Python</h2>
<p>What I love about Python is that it's a very user-friendly programming language since it's not sensitive when it comes to syntax.</p>
<h2>Favorite food: Kare-Kare</h2>
<h2>Hobbies: Playing basketball and watching movies or tv series</h2>
<h2>Childhood dream: Doctor</h2>
